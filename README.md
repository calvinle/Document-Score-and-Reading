# Document Scoring and Comparison

Each iteration of this project is in its own directory. Each increment is more complex than the last with longer code, more class files, etc. Hence, each directory will have its own Makefile. In addition, each directory will also have a README.md file detailing on the specifications of the program at that specific stage. <br/><br/>

The final project consists of the program comparing documents, assigning them reading levels and comparing them with the TFIDF, all within a chosen (and valid) range of reading levels. <br/><br/>
